In left panel, it is the unlensed source, which follows perfect circle Gaussian distribution; In right panel, lensed images is shown, the trianglular shape distortion is because of gravitational lensing flexion.\r\n\r\n### Measuring flexion and calculate the statistical properties under different size of window functions.\r\nUse the command bleow to rebuild Fig. 2.\r\n```bash\r\n$ python2.7 wf_selection.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linan7788626/flexion_holics_python/master/Figures/C_W.jpg)\r\nFigure.2: Figure 2 and Figure 3 in [Goldberg et al 2007](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0607602v2.pdf) can be rebuilt using this python code. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
