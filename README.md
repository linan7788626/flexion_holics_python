# flexion_holics_python

This is a python code to measure gravitational lensing flexion, it is just a naive version, but it works. 
This python code is translated from 
Goldberg's flexion code in IDL. ( http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~goldberg/flexion/ )

Figure.1: It shows the input simulated lensed image with flexions. In left panel, it is the unlensed source, it is perfect circle Gaussian; In right panel, it is lensed images.

Figure.2: Figure 2 and Figure 3 in [Goldberg et al 2007](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0607602v2.pdf) can be rebuild using this python code.
